I am currently working as a Research Intern at [COSIC](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/), [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven), where I am pursuing my Master's thesis. My primary focus lies in the areas of systems and privacy. For my Master's thesis, my primary goal is to develop a privacy-preserving protocol with offline key management, based on the publish-subscribe model, specifically tailored for deployment in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. 

This research internship forms an integral part of my coursework at [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/), where I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Cryptology and Security. Prior to this, I gained valuable industry experience as a Software Engineer at [Societe Generale, Bengaluru](https://globalsolutioncenter.societegenerale.in/en/). 

In 2020, I successfully earned a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), which provided me with a solid foundation in engineering principles and critical thinking.
